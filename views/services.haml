  Right now, the professor says to just let you validate credit
  card numbers and you can do that with:
  %br
  GET api/v1/credit_card/validate?card_number=[your card number]
%p
  Surprisingly enough, you can also view all our credit cards at
  %br
  GET api/v1/credit_card/all/
  -# %a{ href: '/api/v1/credit_card/all/' }
